# Legacy Script Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the legacy scripts that were removed during the ontology-agnostic refactor cleanup.

## Removed Scripts

### ISCO-Specific Legacy Scripts
- `ontologies/isco/scripts/ingest-comprehensive-isco.ts` - Replaced by generic `scripts/ontology/ingest-ontology-dataset.ts`
- `ontologies/isco/scripts/verify-isco-ingestion.ts` - Replaced by generic `scripts/ontology/verify-ontology-data.ts`
- `ontologies/isco/scripts/create-generic-dataset.ts` - Replaced by `ontologies/isco/scripts/create-comprehensive-isco-dataset.ts`

### Generic Legacy Scripts
- `scripts/ontology/isco-only-ingestion.ts` - Replaced by generic `scripts/ontology/ingest-ontology-dataset.ts`
- `scripts/ontology/generic-dataset-ingestion.ts` - Replaced by generic `scripts/ontology/ingest-ontology-dataset.ts`
- `scripts/ontology/clear-isco-database.ts` - Functionality moved to generic verification service
- `scripts/ontology/geonames-only-ingestion.ts` - Replaced by generic `scripts/ontology/ingest-ontology-dataset.ts`
- `scripts/ontology/companies-only-ingestion.ts` - Replaced by generic `scripts/ontology/ingest-ontology-dataset.ts`
- `scripts/ontology/check-isco-data.ts` - Replaced by generic `scripts/ontology/verify-ontology-data.ts`

### Test Files
- `scripts/ontology/__tests__/generic-dataset-ingestion.test.ts` - Test for deleted script
- `scripts/ontology/test-ingestion-with-env.ts` - Test file importing deleted service

### Documentation
- `docs/development/generic-dataset-ingestion.md` - Obsolete documentation for deleted script

## Updated Documentation

The following documentation files were updated to reference the new generic scripts:

1. `ontologies/isco/scripts/README-isco-transformation.md`
2. `docs/development/ontology-agnostic-architecture.md`
3. `docs/architecture/ontologies/geonames.md`
4. `docs/README.md`
5. `ontologies/sp500/README.md`

## Migration Path

All legacy script functionality has been replaced by the new ontology-agnostic architecture:

- **Ingestion**: Use `scripts/ontology/ingest-ontology-dataset.ts --ontology <name> --database <db-name>`
- **Verification**: Use `scripts/ontology/verify-ontology-data.ts --ontology-name <name>`
- **Data Clearing**: Use verification script with `--clear-data` flag

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated multiple similar scripts
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Single generic scripts for common operations
3. **Better Consistency**: Standardized approach across all ontologies
4. **Simplified Documentation**: Clear migration path to new architecture
5. **Reduced Testing Overhead**: Fewer scripts to maintain and test

## Verification

All references to deleted scripts have been verified and updated. No legacy script references remain in the codebase.

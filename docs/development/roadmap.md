## 📊 Success Metrics by Sprint

### Platform Layer (90% Coverage Target)
- Extension registration and discovery
- Cross-extension communication
- Performance: <50ms for routing

### CRM Core (85% Coverage Target)  
- Contact/communication/task management
- External integrations working
- Performance: <100ms for queries

### Financial Extension (80% Coverage Target)
- Deal lifecycle management
- Probability calculations accurate
- Performance: <200ms for complex calculations

### Overall System
- 90% of stories completed per sprint
- <3% defect rate across extensions
- Extension loading <200ms

## 🛠️ Daily TDD Workflow

### Morning Routine (2 hours)
1. **Plan**: Review user story for current sprint
2. **Red**: Write failing tests for new functionality
3. **Verify**: Ensure tests fail for the right reasons

### Afternoon Implementation (4 hours)
1. **Green**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
2. **Integration**: Test cross-extension interactions
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### End of Day Quality (1 hour)
1. **Coverage**: Check module-specific coverage meets targets
2. **Integration**: Verify cross-extension compatibility
3. **Commit**: Push with descriptive commit messages

## 🧪 Testing Strategy by Module

### Module-Specific Commands
```bash
# Platform development
npm run test:platform
npm run coverage:platform

# CRM core development  
npm run test:crm-core
npm run coverage:crm-core

# Financial extension
npm run test:financial
npm run coverage:financial

# Cross-extension testing
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
```

### Quality Gates per Sprint
- All unit tests pass (100%)
- Integration tests pass (100%)
- Code coverage meets module targets
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met

## 🚀 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Extension complexity**: Start with simple financial extension
- **Integration challenges**: Mock external APIs early
- **Performance issues**: Implement caching and optimization from start
- **Testing complexity**: Use comprehensive test doubles strategy

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined MVP for each sprint
- **Dependencies**: Mock external services to avoid blocking
- **Resource constraints**: Focus on one extension at a time
- **Quality vs speed**: Never compromise on test coverage

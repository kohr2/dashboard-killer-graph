- All processing logic centralized in `platform/processing/`
- Eliminates code duplication
- Ensures consistent behavior across the application

### 2. Reusability
- Services can be used by multiple domains
- Standardized interfaces and error handling
- Consistent processing patterns

### 3. Maintainability
- Single location for processing logic
- Easier to update and maintain
- Better separation of concerns

### 4. Testability
- Services are easily mockable
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Clear interfaces for testing

## New Architecture

```
src/platform/processing/
â”œâ”€â”€ email-parsing.service.ts          # âœ… New service (moved to src/ingestion/)
â”œâ”€â”€ attachment-processing.service.ts   # âœ… New service
â”œâ”€â”€ neo4j-ingestion.service.ts        # âœ… Existing (updated)
â”œâ”€â”€ content-processing.service.ts      # âœ… Existing
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ enrichment.utils.ts           # âœ… Migrated
```

## Integration Examples

### Email Processing with Attachments
```typescript
import { EmailProcessor } from '@ingestion/sources/email/processors/email-processor';
import { EmailParsingService } from '@ingestion/email-parsing.service';
import { AttachmentProcessingService } from '@platform/processing/attachment-processing.service';

const emailProcessor = new EmailProcessor(
  new EmailParsingService(),
  new AttachmentProcessingService()
);

const result = await emailProcessor.processEmlFileWithAttachments('/path/to/email.eml');
```

### Direct Service Usage
```typescript
import { AttachmentProcessingService } from '@platform/processing/attachment-processing.service';

const attachmentProcessor = new AttachmentProcessingService();
const result = await attachmentProcessor.processAttachments(attachments);
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each service has comprehensive unit tests
- Tests located near source files in `__tests__/` directories
- Mock dependencies for isolated testing

### Integration Tests
- Test service interactions
- Verify end-to-end processing
- Test error scenarios

### Demo Scripts
- `scripts/demo/test-attachment-processing.ts`: Comprehensive attachment processing demo
- Demonstrates all supported file types
- Shows error handling and performance metrics

## Performance Improvements

### Processing Time Tracking
- Each attachment processing includes duration metrics
- Batch processing for multiple attachments
- Performance monitoring and optimization

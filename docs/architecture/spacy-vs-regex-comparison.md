# spaCy vs Regex Entity Extraction: Why spaCy is Superior

## Overview

This document compares **spaCy** with **regex** for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in our O-CREAM-v2 CRM system. spaCy provides significantly superior accuracy, context awareness, and robustness.

## Quick Answer: Why spaCy is Better

**spaCy uses machine learning and linguistic understanding, while regex uses pattern matching.** This fundamental difference makes spaCy dramatically more accurate for real-world entity extraction.

## Key Advantages of spaCy

### 1. Context Awareness ✅
- **Understands linguistic context** and word relationships
- **Disambiguates entities** based on surrounding text
- **Handles ambiguous cases** like "Apple" (company) vs "apple" (fruit)

### 2. Pre-trained Models ✅
- **Trained on large corpora** (OntoNotes 5.0 with 1.6M+ words)
- **F1 Score: 85-95%** depending on model
- **20+ built-in entity types**

### 3. Multi-word Entity Handling ✅
- "Goldman Sachs Group Inc." → Single ORG entity
- "John F. Kennedy Jr. Memorial Foundation" → Complete recognition

## Implementation

Our system now includes SpacyEntityExtractionService that:
- Integrates with O-CREAM-v2 ontology
- Provides fallback to regex when needed
- Supports multiple spaCy models (sm, lg, trf)
- Includes comparison capabilities

## Installation

```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm    # Small model (50MB)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg    # Large model (750MB) 
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf   # Transformer (560MB)
```

## Conclusion

spaCy is dramatically superior to regex for entity extraction due to its context-aware understanding, pre-trained models, and robust handling of real-world text variations.

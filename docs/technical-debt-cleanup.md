# Technical Debt Cleanup Plan

## 🎯 Current Status

Based on the latest analysis, the project has been significantly cleaned up. The following items represent the remaining technical debt that should be addressed:

## 🔥 High Priority Items

### Core Infrastructure
- [ ] `src/platform/extension-framework/event-bus.ts:37` - Add proper logging system
- [ ] `src/ontologies/crm/application/services/contact.service.ts:110` - Implement robust search
- [ ] `src/ingestion/sources/email/email-source.ts:40-72` - Complete email processing logic

### Critical Missing Implementations
- [ ] `src/ingestion/sources/email/processors/attachment-processor.ts` - Implement actual PDF/DOCX/OCR processing
- [ ] `src/ingestion/intelligence/nlp/entity-extractor.ts` - Migrate to unified types
- [ ] `src/ingestion/core/pipeline/ingestion-pipeline.ts` - Complete pipeline implementation

## 📊 Medium Priority Items

### Repository Pattern Completion
- [ ] Complete missing repository methods across all `i-*-repository.ts` files
- [ ] Implement unified storage manager integration
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation

### Type Safety Improvements
- [ ] Replace remaining `any` types with proper interfaces
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for email processing results
- [ ] Implement runtime validation with Zod where needed

## 🔧 Low Priority Items

### Documentation & Exports
- [ ] Complete `index.ts` files with proper exports
- [ ] Update interface definitions for API and UI components
- [ ] Remove deprecated method markers after migration

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

1. **Focus on Core Functionality**: Complete the email processing pipeline and entity extraction
2. **Improve Type Safety**: Replace `any` types with proper interfaces
3. **Complete Repository Pattern**: Implement missing repository methods
4. **Clean Up Exports**: Organize and complete index files

## 📈 Success Metrics

- All critical TODO items resolved
- Email processing pipeline fully functional
- Repository pattern consistently implemented
- Type safety improved (minimal `any` usage)
- Clean and organized exports

# Email Attachment Processing

## Overview

This document describes the email attachment processing capabilities that have been added to the email-ingestion pipeline. The feature enables the system to process email attachments and extract text content and entities from various file formats.

## Features

### Supported File Types

- **PDF Documents** (`application/pdf`)
- **Microsoft Word Documents** (`application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`, `application/msword`)
- **Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets** (`application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`, `application/vnd.ms-excel`) - XLSX and XLS formats
- **Microsoft PowerPoint Presentations** (`application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`, `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint`) - PPTX and PPT formats
- **Images** (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/gif`) - via OCR
- **Plain Text** (`text/plain`)

### Capabilities

1. **Text Extraction**: Extracts readable text from supported attachment formats
2. **Entity Recognition**: Identifies and extracts entities (monetary amounts, names, organizations, dates) from attachment content
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles unsupported formats and processing errors
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing email processing pipeline

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### `AttachmentProcessor`
- **Location**: `src/ingestion/sources/email/processors/attachment-processor.ts`
- **Purpose**: Main processor for handling email attachments
- **Key Methods**:
  - `processAttachments()`: Process multiple attachments
  - `extractTextFromPdf()`: Extract text from PDF files
  - `extractTextFromDocx()`: Extract text from Word documents
  - `extractTextFromExcel()`: Extract text from Excel spreadsheets
  - `extractTextFromPowerPoint()`: Extract text from PowerPoint presentations
  - `extractTextFromImage()`: Extract text from images using OCR
  - `isSupportedFileType()`: Check if file type is supported

#### `EmailProcessor`
- **Location**: `src/ingestion/sources/email/processors/email-processor.ts`
- **Purpose**: Unified email processor with attachment support
- **Key Method**: `processEmlFileWithAttachments()`: Process emails with attachment processing

#### Interface Types
- **Location**: `src/ingestion/sources/email/types/email.interface.ts`
- **Defines**:
  - `EmailAttachment`: Attachment data structure
  - `ProcessedAttachment`: Processing result for each attachment
  - `AttachmentProcessingResult`: Overall processing result
  - `ExtractedEntity`: Entity data structure

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { EmailProcessor } from './src/ingestion/sources/email/processors/email-processor';

const emailProcessor = new EmailProcessor();
const result = await emailProcessor.processEmlFileWithAttachments('/path/to/email.eml');

console.log(`Processed ${result.attachmentProcessing?.totalProcessed} attachments`);
console.log(`Extracted ${result.entities.length} entities`);
```

### Testing the Feature

Run the demo script to test attachment processing with sample emails:

```bash
npm run demo:attachment-processing
```

This will:
1. Process sample .eml files from the `test-emails` directory
2. Demonstrate attachment processing capabilities
3. Show entity extraction from both email content and attachments

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

#### `AttachmentProcessor` Tests
- **Location**: `src/ingestion/sources/email/processors/__tests__/attachment-processor.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - PDF attachment processing
  - Word document processing
  - Image OCR processing
  - Unsupported file type handling
  - Error handling
  - Multiple attachment processing

#### `EmailProcessor` Integration Tests
- **Location**: `src/ingestion/sources/email/processors/__tests__/email-processor-with-attachments.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Email processing with attachments
  - Entity merging from attachments and email content
  - Error handling in integration scenarios
  - Backward compatibility

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all attachment-related tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="attachment.*test.ts"

# Run specific attachment processor tests
npm test -- src/ingestion/sources/email/processors/__tests__/attachment-processor.test.ts
```

## Implementation Details

### Text Extraction Methods

1. **PDF Processing**: Uses mock implementation (TODO: integrate pdf-parse library)
2. **DOCX Processing**: Uses mock implementation (TODO: integrate mammoth library)
3. **Excel Processing**: Uses `node-xlsx` library for spreadsheet data extraction from all worksheets
4. **PowerPoint Processing**: Uses `officeparser` library for presentation text extraction from all slides
5. **OCR Processing**: Uses mock implementation (TODO: integrate tesseract.js library)
6. **Plain Text**: Direct UTF-8 decoding

### Entity Extraction

- Uses pattern matching for demonstration
- Extracts monetary amounts, person names, organizations, and dates
- Each entity includes confidence score and position information
- Metadata tracks extraction source and method

### Error Handling

- Gracefully handles unsupported file types
- Logs errors for debugging
- Continues processing other attachments if one fails
- Returns detailed error information in results

## Future Enhancements

### Priority Improvements

1. **Real Text Extraction Libraries**:
   - Integrate `pdf-parse` for PDF text extraction
   - Integrate `mammoth` for DOCX text extraction
   - Integrate `tesseract.js` for OCR capabilities

2. **Advanced Entity Extraction**:
   - Integration with existing SpaCy entity extraction service
   - Support for financial document specific entities
   - Relationship extraction between entities

3. **Additional File Formats**:
   - CSV files
   - RTF documents
   - OpenDocument formats (ODS, ODT, ODP)

### Technical Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Parallel processing of multiple attachments
   - Caching of extracted content
   - Streaming for large files

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - File size limits
   - Virus scanning integration
   - Content sanitization

3. **Configuration**:
   - Configurable supported file types
   - Adjustable processing timeouts
   - OCR language settings

## Integration with Existing Pipeline

The attachment processing feature is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing email processing pipeline:

1. **Email Processing Service**: Updated to include attachment processing placeholder
2. **Entity Merging**: Entities from attachments are merged with email content entities
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Extracted entities can be inserted into the knowledge graph
4. **Unified Pipeline**: Ready for integration with the unified ingestion pipeline

## TDD Approach

This feature was developed following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. **Red Phase**: Written failing tests first
2. **Green Phase**: Implemented minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improved code quality and added integration

All tests pass and provide comprehensive coverage of the attachment processing functionality.

## Demo and Examples

### Running the Demo

```bash
npm run demo:attachment-processing

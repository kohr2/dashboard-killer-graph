# üß† Conversational Knowledge Platform (The Dashboard Killer)

[![CI/CD](https://github.com/your-org/dashboard-killer-graph/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-org/dashboard-killer-graph/actions)
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-85%25-green.svg)](./docs/testing/coverage-report.md)
[![Architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/architecture-modular-brightgreen.svg)](./docs/architecture/overview.md)

An **ontology-driven, extensible platform** that uses a knowledge graph and Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace traditional dashboards with intelligent, conversational insights.

Instead of being a monolithic application, this project is a **core platform** that provides a framework for building and running independent, domain-specific **ontology extensions**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dashboard-killer-graph.git
cd dashboard-killer-graph
npm install

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# 3. Start Neo4j Database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.neo4j.yml up -d

# 4. Start the main API server
npm run dev

# 5. Start the Chat UI (in a separate terminal)
cd chat-ui && npm run dev

# 6. Start the MCP Server for Claude Desktop (optional, in a separate terminal)
npm run dev:mcp
```

## üéØ Access Points

- **Chat UI**: http://localhost:5173/ (or 5174 if 5173 is busy)
- **API Server**: http://localhost:3001
- **Neo4j Browser**: http://localhost:7474 (username: neo4j, password: password)
- **MCP Server**: Connects to Claude Desktop for AI-powered queries

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture: Platform + Extensions

The system is composed of a central **Platform** and multiple **Extensions**.

```
      +-------------------------+
      |      Platform Core      |
      | (Framework, Tooling)    |
      +-----------+-------------+
                  |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
|                 |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-------+ +-------+-------+ +-------+-----------------+
|   CRM Ontology Extension  | | Financial Ontology Ext. | | Procurement Ontology Ext. |
| (Contacts, Orgs)        | | (Deals, Investments)    | | (Contracts, Tenders)      |
+-------------------------+ +-------------------------+ +-------------------------+
```

-   **Platform Core**: Provides the essential services: extension loading, knowledge graph connection (Neo4j), conversational interface, and shared tools. It is domain-agnostic.
-   **Ontology Extensions**: Self-contained modules that define a specific business domain (e.g., CRM, Finance, Procurement). Each extension contributes its own data model (`ontology.json`), business logic, and services to the platform. Extensions are automatically discovered and loaded by the plugin registry.

This modular design allows new capabilities to be added without modifying the core platform.

## üí¨ Chat Interface Features

The system includes a fully functional conversational interface that:

- ‚úÖ **Natural Language Processing**: Understands queries like "show me all deals" or "list all people"
- ‚úÖ **Multi-language Support**: Works in English, French, and other languages
- ‚úÖ **Entity Recognition**: Recognizes synonyms (people/persons, deals/projects)
- ‚úÖ **Relationship Queries**: Can find related entities ("show organizations related to Rick")
- ‚úÖ **Rich Responses**: Uses OpenAI to format results in natural language
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Data**: Queries live data from Neo4j knowledge graph

### Example Queries
```
"show all deals"
"list all people"
"show me organizations"
"find contacts related to Thoma Bravo"
"show me all persons"
```

## üéØ Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
-   [x] **Platform Core**: Modular framework for extension loading and orchestration.
-   [x] **Ontology-Driven Design**: Extensions are built around a central `ontology.json` file.
-   [x] **Plugin Architecture**: Dynamic plugin discovery and registration system.
-   [x] **Chat Interface**: Fully functional conversational UI with natural language processing.
-   [x] **Query Translation**: OpenAI-powered translation from natural language to structured queries.
-   [x] **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Real-time queries to Neo4j database.
-   [x] **Multi-language Support**: Works in English, French, and other languages.
-   [x] **MCP Server**: Integration with Claude Desktop for AI-powered assistance.
-   [x] **CRM & Financial Extensions**: Foundational extensions for CRM and Finance domains.
-   [x] **Procurement Extension**: Public procurement ontology with 227 entities and 595 relationships.
-   [x] **Compact Ontology & Prompt Partitioning**: New compact ontology format (‚âà 98 % size reduction) and partitioned prompt generation for efficient LLM interaction. Entity (`e`) and relationship (`r`) lists are now alphabetically sorted for deterministic diffing.
-   [x] **Automated Code Generation**: Ontology-to-code generation with plugin templates.
-   [x] **TDD Foundation**: Comprehensive test structure with Jest.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests
npm test

# Run tests for a specific ontology extension
npm run lint:ontology:crm
npm run lint:ontology:financial

# Test chat functionality
npm run chat:test
```

## üêû Prompt & Ontology Debugging

The NLP micro-service can optionally persist every prompt it sends to OpenAI, along with the compact ontology JSON, to help you inspect and fine-tune the extraction pipeline.

| Environment Variable      | Default                | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENABLE_PROMPT_DEBUG`     | `0`                    | Set to `1` to enable writing prompt and ontology files to disk.    |
| `PROMPT_DEBUG_DIR`        | `/tmp/llm-prompts`     | Directory where files are written. Can be absolute or relative.    |

Example:

```bash
# Enable prompt debugging in your terminal before starting the NLP service
export ENABLE_PROMPT_DEBUG=1
export PROMPT_DEBUG_DIR="$(pwd)/debug-prompts"
uvicorn python-services/nlp-service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# After running an ingestion you will find files like:
#   debug-prompts/compact-ontology-<timestamp>.json
#   debug-prompts/prompt-<timestamp>.txt
```

Disable by leaving `ENABLE_PROMPT_DEBUG` unset or set to `0` (the default).

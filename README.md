[![Architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/architecture-modular-brightgreen.svg)](./docs/architecture/overview.md)

An **ontology-driven, extensible platform** that uses a knowledge graph and Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace traditional dashboards with intelligent, conversational insights.

Instead of being a monolithic application, this project is a **core platform** that provides a framework for building and running independent, domain-specific **ontology extensions**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dashboard-killer-graph.git
cd dashboard-killer-graph
npm install

# 2. Start Core Infrastructure
# This starts Neo4j.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.neo4j.yml up -d

# 3. Start AI Service (in a separate terminal)
# For entity extraction, the Python NLP service must be running.
# First time setup:
npm run setup:nlp
# Start the service:
npm run start:nlp

# 4. Run the demo ingestion script
# This script processes sample emails and builds the knowledge graph.
npm run demo:ingest

# 5. Run tests
npm test
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture: Platform + Extensions

The system is composed of a central **Platform** and multiple **Extensions**.

```
      +-------------------------+
      |      Platform Core      |
      | (Framework, Tooling)    |
      +-----------+-------------+
                  |
+-----------------+-----------------+
|                 |                 |
+-----------------+-------+ +-------+-----------------+
|   CRM Ontology Extension  | | Financial Ontology Ext. |
| (Contacts, Orgs)        | | (Deals, Investments)    |
+-------------------------+ +-------------------------+
```

-   **Platform Core**: Provides the essential services: extension loading, knowledge graph connection (Neo4j), conversational interface, and shared tools. It is domain-agnostic.
-   **Ontology Extensions**: Self-contained modules that define a specific business domain (e.g., CRM, Finance). Each extension contributes its own data model (`ontology.json`), business logic, and services to the platform.

This modular design allows new capabilities to be added without modifying the core platform.

## üéØ Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
-   [x] **Platform Core**: Modular framework for extension loading and orchestration.
-   [x] **Ontology-Driven Design**: Extensions are built around a central `ontology.json` file.
-   [x] **High-Performance Ingestion**: A batch pipeline for processing documents in parallel.
-   [x] **CRM & Financial Extensions**: Foundational extensions for CRM and Finance domains.
-   [x] **TDD Foundation**: Comprehensive test structure with Jest.

### üìã Next Steps
-   **API Development**: Build a generic API layer to expose extension services.
-   **Conversational UI**: Create the chat interface for interacting with the knowledge graph.
-   **Agentic Workflows**: Develop AI agents that can reason across different ontologies.

See the [Development Roadmap](./docs/development/roadmap.md) for more details.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests

Dear John Smith,

I am writing to provide an update on market data for financial instruments with Bloomberg. Reference Number FIBO-302573 reflects a transaction amount of 45831.45 CAD on 7/8/2025. As the Regulatory Manager, I advise on AccountChangeNotificationObligation to ensure accurate account details. Bloomberg, as the AccountProvider, authorizes financial transactions for AccountHolders. Your role in AccountManagement is crucial for maintaining AccountOwnership integrity.

Please review the latest data and notify relevant parties of any changes promptly. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Nathan Reed
Regulatory Manager

Dear David Brown,

I am reaching out with a request for a risk assessment of financial instruments, specifically focusing on AbsolutePrepaymentRate, as we engage with Moody's. This assessment is crucial for our ongoing operations. Kindly advise on the authorization process for this engagement, considering our AccountChangeNotificationObligation. The amount involved is 23574.25 CAD.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Nathan Reed
Regulatory Manager

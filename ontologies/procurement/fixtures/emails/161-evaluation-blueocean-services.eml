Dear Michael Miller,

I hope this message finds you well. As the Officer at the procurement department, I am reaching out to request an evaluation regarding consulting services with vendor BlueOcean Services for the amount of 32412.95 JPY. We would like to assess the consulting proposal in relation to the Selection Criteria and Award Criteria outlined in our procurement documents. 

Could you please provide a detailed evaluation report including the compliance with the Selection Criteria and any recommendations for the award decision based on the consultation expertise offered by BlueOcean Services?

Looking forward to your prompt feedback on this matter.

Best regards,
Lisa Kim
Officer at the Procurement Department

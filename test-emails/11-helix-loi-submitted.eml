Committee,

Following a positive management meeting and preliminary diligence, we have officially submitted a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) for Project Helix.

Our bid is based on a pre-money valuation of $500M. We have requested a 30-day exclusivity period to complete our confirmatory diligence.

We expect to hear back from Morgan Stanley early next week. The latest on Project Helix is that we are now awaiting their response to our LOI.

Regards,
Jane Miller

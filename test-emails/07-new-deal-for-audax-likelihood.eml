Team,

Sourced a new opportunity: "Project Anvil". It's a family-owned manufacturer of specialty fasteners for the aerospace industry.

- Target: Anvil Fasteners Inc.
- Sector: Industrial Machinery (GICS: 20106020)
- Revenue: $60M
- Deal Type: Buyout

This feels like a classic Audax-type deal given their Buy & Build strategy in the industrials space. I wouldn't be surprised if they are a likely bidder in this process. We should anticipate competition.

Let me know if I should pursue this further.

Team,

Closing the loop on the Project Gotham NDA.

Our legal team has reviewed and approved the NDA. We have executed it and returned it to Gotham Security's counsel.

We now have access to the CIM and the data room. The NDA is no longer in anyone's court; the ball is back in our court to begin due diligence.

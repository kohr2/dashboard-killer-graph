MP,

Closing the loop on the Blackstone follow-up for Project Apex.

I spoke with their associate, Tom, this afternoon. He was cagey but my read is that their interest is lukewarm. They seem to be more focused on a larger deal in the same space.

I am no longer responsible for following up with Blackstone on this matter unless we hear from them again. My task is complete.

Happy to discuss my thoughts on our bidding strategy.

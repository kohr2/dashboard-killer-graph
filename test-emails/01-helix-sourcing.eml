Hi Team,

We're introducing "Project Helix," an exclusive opportunity to invest in a high-growth B2B SaaS company in the project management space.

- Target: HelixFlow Solutions
- Sector: Application Software (GICS: 45103010)
- ARR: $40M (growing 80% YoY)
- Process: Bilateral, seeking a lead growth partner

The company has a strong enterprise client base and best-in-class net revenue retention. This is a primary capital raise to fund international expansion.

Let me know if Vista Equity Partners is interested, and we can schedule a management presentation.

Best,
David Chen

Committee,

A quick, final update on Project Helix.

Morgan Stanley informed us this morning that the company has decided to accept an offer from Blackstone. Their offer was significantly higher on valuation and offered more flexible terms.

The latest on Project Helix is that the deal is now lost. We will send a debrief memo later this week to capture our key learnings from this process.

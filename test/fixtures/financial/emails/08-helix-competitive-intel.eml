Jane,

The management presentation for Project Helix is scheduled for this Friday.

On a separate note, I have it on good authority that Blackstone is also evaluating this opportunity. My source says they are very interested. We should be prepared for a competitive dynamic if we decide to proceed with an IOI.

I will share my notes from the meeting by EOD Friday.

Team,

Quick update on Project Titan following our review of the CIM.

The asset is solid, but my channel checks suggest Audax is also looking closely at this deal. Given their history with industrial software roll-ups, the likelihood of them bidding is high. This will be a competitive process.

Our internal model suggests a valuation of 8.0x - 9.0x EBITDA.

Next Steps:
- Activity: Submit an Indication of Interest (IOI)
- Due Date: 2025-07-10
- Assigned To: junior.analyst@example-pe-firm.com

The deployment pressure on Example Capital Partners V is high, so let's be aggressive here.

Regards,
Senior Partner

Team,

Sourced a new opportunity, "Project Lifeline," which looks very similar to our successful "Project Nightingale" investment.

- Deal: Project Lifeline (Buyout)
- Target: Lifeline Home Health Group
- Sector: Health Care Providers & Services (GICS: 351020)
- Process: Proprietary, relationship-sourced

This is a roll-up of smaller home care agencies. Given we have seen a similar process before with Nightingale, our playbook should apply directly. The firm has a strong preference for this type of deal.

Recommend we engage immediately.

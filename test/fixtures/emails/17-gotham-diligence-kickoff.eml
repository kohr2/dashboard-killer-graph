Team,

Now that we have the CIM for Project Gotham, let's kick off our diligence workstreams.

- Financial: Lisa, you are responsible for building the financial model. Please focus on the quality of recurring revenue.
- Legal: Counsel to review all customer contracts.
- Commercial: I will handle the customer calls.

The latest on Project Gotham is that we are now in the due diligence phase. Let's maintain momentum.

Rick
Partner, Thoma Bravo

Committee,

This memo outlines our recommendation to pass on "Project Evergreen," a venture-stage investment in the renewable energy sector.

- Deal: Project Evergreen (Venture Capital)
- Sector: Renewable Electricity (GICS: 10102040)

While the market is promising, this is an early-stage, pre-revenue company. It does not fit Audax's core strategy of investing in established, middle-market companies where we can apply our Buy & Build playbook. The likelihood of us pursuing this type of venture deal is very low.

We have informed the banker that we are not moving forward.

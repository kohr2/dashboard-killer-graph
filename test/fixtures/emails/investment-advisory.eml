Dear Mr. Johnson,

Following our discussion about your portfolio diversification strategy, I've prepared the following recommendations for Q1 2024:

CURRENT PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS:
- Total Portfolio Value: $2,750,000
- Asset Allocation: 65% Equity, 25% Fixed Income, 10% Alternatives
- YTD Performance: +8.2% (vs S&P 500: +7.1%)

RECOMMENDED POSITIONS:

1. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS)
   - Current Price: $350.25
   - Target Allocation: 3.5% of portfolio ($96,250)
   - P/E Ratio: 11.2
   - Dividend Yield: 2.8%

2. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) 
   - Strong buy recommendation
   - Current Price: $415.50
   - Target: $450 (12-month outlook)

3. U.S. Treasury Bond CUSIP: 912828XG0
   - 10-year maturity, 4.2% yield
   - AAA rating
   - Allocation: $275,000 (10% of portfolio)

4. Currency Hedge Position

RISK METRICS:
- Portfolio Beta: 0.95
- Value at Risk (95%, 1-day): $45,000
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.34

The recommended rebalancing would adjust your risk profile from 0.78 to 0.65, providing better downside protection while maintaining growth potential.

COMPLIANCE NOTES:
- All recommendations comply with MiFID II regulations
- Risk disclosure: Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Derivative instruments carry substantial risk of loss

Please review the attached detailed analysis and prospectus documents. I'd like to schedule a follow-up call this week to discuss implementation.

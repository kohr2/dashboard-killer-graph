Team,

This memo summarizes our decision to pass on "Project Jetstream," the opportunity in the aviation software space (GICS: 20303010 - Aerospace & Defense).

While the asset had strong financials, the process was a broad auction with aggressive valuation expectations from the seller. This is not a similar process to our typical proprietary, relationship-driven deals.

We submitted a bid but were ultimately outbid by a strategic acquirer. We will continue to monitor the space for opportunities that better fit our core thesis.

Dear Christopher Moore, 

I am reaching out as Category Manager at our procurement department regarding a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for maintenance services. We are interested in exploring potential opportunities with Vertex Construction for the amount of 35554.64 USD. Could you provide the necessary information and pricing details as per the AccessTerm requirements for this RFQ? Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to a fruitful collaboration.

Best regards,
James Johnson
Category Manager

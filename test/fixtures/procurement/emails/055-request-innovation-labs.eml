We would like to engage in a comprehensive assessment of our procurement procedures to identify areas for improvement and innovation. The estimated budget for this project is 26344.05 EUR.

To initiate this collaboration, we would appreciate if Innovation Labs could provide us with a detailed proposal outlining their approach, methodology, and timeline for the analysis. Additionally, we are open to discussing any specific requirements or preferences you may have for this project.

Looking forward to your prompt response and further discussion on how we can work together to enhance our procurement processes.

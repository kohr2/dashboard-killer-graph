Dear Maria Garcia,

I hope this message finds you well. We are interested in procuring raw materials under our framework agreement FA-2025-003, lot group LG-Supplies-02, and would like to request a quote from Global Supplies Ltd for an amount of 1313.06 GBP.

Our participation request processing team, led by Jennifer Smith, will handle all participation requests for this procurement. The tender processing will be managed by Carlos Rodriguez, and our appointed mediator, Thomas Anderson from Procurement Mediation Group, will oversee the entire process.

The review procedure will be conducted by our review panel chaired by Dr. Sarah Williams, who will evaluate all submissions. Could you please provide the necessary Procurement Documents via an agreed AdHocChannel for our review? Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
James Johnson
Category Manager

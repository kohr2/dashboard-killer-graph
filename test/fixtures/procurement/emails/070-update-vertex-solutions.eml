Dear Sarah Wilson,

I am writing to update you on the analysis with vendor Vertex Solutions for Reference Number PROCUREMENT-562713. The StatisticalInformation from the procedure indicates a potential inconsistency between the TenderEvaluation and admissibleTender values. We also need to consider the impact on the highest and lowest Tender values. Could you kindly review these aspects with Vertex Solutions to ensure alignment?

Your attention to the details concerning hasHighestReceivedTenderValue and hasLowestReceivedTenderValue will be crucial for accurate evaluation. Let me know if you require further information or assistance in this matter.

Best regards,

Rebecca Gonzalez

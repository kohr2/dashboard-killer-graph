Dear Christopher Moore,

I am pleased to confirm the development collaboration with Prime Partners for an amount of 2011.96 GBP. As part of this process, we will be utilizing the ProcurementObject to specify the goods and services involved. Prime Partners will be acting as the OfferingParty, providing their expertise in this innovative procurement endeavor. 

We will ensure that the ProcurementDocument outlining the project details is accessible to all relevant parties. Additionally, the SubmissionTerm will define the conditions for submitting the necessary documents. We look forward to a successful partnership to achieve our procurement objectives.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Michael Allen
Officer at the Procurement Department

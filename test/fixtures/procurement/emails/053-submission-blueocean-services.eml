Dear Sarah Wilson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally submit a request for training services from BlueOcean Services, our esteemed vendor. As per our procurement requirements, we are in need of specialized training in the area of Green Procurement to enhance our strategic approach towards sustainability initiatives.

In line with our procurement procedures, the training session is crucial to align our team with the principles of Social Procurement and Green Procurement. The session will focus on innovative procurement approaches and the impact of environmental considerations in our purchasing activities. The estimated budget allocated for this training is 32243.65 JPY.

To ensure a seamless process, we kindly request BlueOcean Services to provide detailed information on the training curriculum, duration, and any prerequisites for participation. This information will aid us in evaluating the training offer against our Selection Criteria and making an informed decision.

Additionally, we anticipate that the training submission will include the maximum estimated value for the training program and any subcontracting obligations involved. This will assist us in assessing the financial offer value and confirming the suitability of the training proposal.

We look forward to strengthening our partnership through this training collaboration and advancing our procurement practices. Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out.

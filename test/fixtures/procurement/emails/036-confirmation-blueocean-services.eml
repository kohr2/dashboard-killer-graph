I am writing to confirm the upcoming training session with vendor BlueOcean Services regarding the procurement process. The training will cover essential aspects such as Procedure Types, Selection Criteria, and Awarding Values. Please note that the estimated value for this training is 16981.01 GBP.

As the Supervisor at the procurement department, I have coordinated this training to enhance our team's understanding and efficiency in procurement operations. Should you have any specific topics you would like to be included, please feel free to share them with me.

Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring our team's continuous professional development.

Best regards,
Matthew Clark

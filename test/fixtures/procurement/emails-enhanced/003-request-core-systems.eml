We are particularly interested in exploring statistical information related to the procurement procedure and the lot, as well as the maximum framework agreement awarded value.

Could you please provide insights on the estimated value and the awarded value for this project? Additionally, any details on the highest and lowest received tender values would be greatly appreciated for our analysis.

Looking forward to your prompt response and collaboration with Core Systems for a successful procurement outcome.

Thank you and best regards,

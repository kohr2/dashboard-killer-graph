Dear Robert Johnson,

I hope this message finds you well. As the Coordinator at the procurement department, I am reaching out regarding the evaluation of equipment from Global Solutions Ltd. The awarded value for the lot is set at 26,946.46 GBP. We are particularly interested in assessing the financial offer value provided by Global Solutions Ltd for this equipment procurement.

Could you please provide the financial offer value for the equipment lot as part of the evaluation process? Your prompt assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this request.

Best regards,
Amanda King
Procurement Department Coordinator

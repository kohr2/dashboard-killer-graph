Dear Christopher Moore,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to request an evaluation regarding the training session conducted by BlueOcean Services, as part of our procurement operations. The StatisticalInformation on the Procedure and the Lot indicate a need for thorough assessment of the training's impact. Could you kindly provide insights into the training's effectiveness in enhancing our Procurement processes?

Additionally, considering the amount allocated for this training session is 31552.99 JPY, we aim to ensure optimal utilization of resources. Your evaluation will greatly assist us in determining the value derived from this training initiative.

Looking forward to your detailed feedback to enhance our future training engagements.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
John Allen
Technique, Procurement Department

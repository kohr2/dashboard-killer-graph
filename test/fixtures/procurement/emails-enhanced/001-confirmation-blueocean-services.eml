Dear Christopher Moore,

I am writing to confirm our support for BlueOcean Services in the procurement process. The estimated value for the procedure is 15085.64 EUR. As per the eProcurement Ontology, the awarded value will be crucial in determining the outcome. We foresee the involvement of Subcontractors in this process as outlined by our relationship with the Subcontractor entity.

Your collaboration is highly appreciated as we aim for a successful procurement outcome. Should you require any further assistance or information, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best Regards,
Michael Chen
Senior Specialist, Procurement

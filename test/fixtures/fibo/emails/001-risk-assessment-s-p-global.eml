Dear David Brown,

I am conducting a risk-assessment regarding regulatory reporting with S&P Global. We need to ensure compliance with AccountChangeNotificationObligation to notify of any account details changes. The total amount involved is 22626.50 GBP. Your insights on our relationship with S&P Global are crucial for the assessment. Please advise on any concerns or recommendations.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Sophia Bell
Financial Controller

Dear Amanda Taylor,

I am conducting a risk assessment for financial instruments with S&P Global. The AbsolutePrepaymentRate and AccountingTransaction relationships are crucial for evaluating the impact of our investments. Could you provide insights on how S&P Global advises on AbsolutePrepaymentRate and authorizes AccountingTransactions? Your expertise will help us mitigate risks effectively.

Amount: 21772.20 USD
Date: 7/8/2025

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Philip Morgan
Compliance Analyst

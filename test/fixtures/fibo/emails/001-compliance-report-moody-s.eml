Dear Sarah Wilson,

I am writing to provide the compliance-report regarding financial instruments with Moody's. The AbsolutePrepaymentRate for the current month is within standard limits. Our AccountingFramework has been implemented effectively to ensure accurate reporting. Kindly review the AccountChangeNotificationObligation and AccountOwnership details for completeness. Should you require further information, please advise.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
William Murphy
Regulatory Affairs Manager

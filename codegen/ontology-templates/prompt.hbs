You MUST include mappings for these essential terms if relevant entities exist:\n   - 'persons' and 'people' → all person/agent related entities\n   - 'agents' → agent-related entities\n   - 'companies' and 'organizations' → business/organization entities\n   - 'contracts' → contract/agreement entities\n   - 'projects' → project/process related entities\n   - 'documents' → document related entities\n\n2. Analyze the entity names and descriptions to identify semantic groupings\n3. Consider alternative labels and common synonyms\n4. Map plural forms (e.g., 'persons', 'people', 'agents', 'companies')\n5. Be comprehensive - include all relevant entity types for each semantic category\n\nGenerate mappings in this JSON format:\n{\n  'common_term': ['entity_type1', 'entity_type2'],\n  'another_term': ['entity_type3', 'entity_type4']\n}\n\nBe thorough and include all relevant mappings. Users should be able to query using natural language terms.\n\nReturn only the JSON object, no other text."
